          Could this site have been built with a less number of moving parts and
          made simpler and cheaper to construct? Absolutely! But where's the fun
          in that! This is a great way to showcase some of my technical
          capabilities!

          I've incorporated a number of the Cloud Architecture principles like
          High Availability, Serverless, decoupled services, analytics,
          automation... to name a few. Quoting someone famous - Everything fails
          all the time, right?! So wanted to make sure I had it all covered!
